            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My educational and professional journey has been diverse and non-linear, reflecting a unique path to my current position. I graduated from Utah State University in 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in Geography Education and a minor in School Library Media. Following my graduation, I taught second grade at a charter school in Holladay, Utah. While I enjoyed the students, I realized that the challenges presented by parents and administration were not the right fit for me.</p>
                <p>In 2017, I transitioned to a role as a Medical Staffing Assistant at CompHealth, where I advanced to the position of Assignment Coordinator after a year. In this role, I provided support to the Anesthesiology sales team until I took maternity leave in 2019 following the birth of my first son. After six months, I returned to the workforce as a Licensed Massage Therapist at Elements Massage in Cottonwood Heights. I graduated from the Utah College of Massage Therapy in Salt Lake City before completing my degree at Utah State. This position allowed me to support myself while attending school, and provided a flexible work schedule during my son’s early years.</p>
                <p>My second son was born in June 2023, and I have since focused on his care due to some unexpected medical challenges. Now that he is 16 months old, healthy, and thriving, and my oldest son is in kindergarten, I am eager to re-enter the workforce. I am adaptable, detail-oriented, and well-organized, with a flexible availability that allows me to balance my professional aspirations with my responsibilities at home. Recently, I completed the Tech-Moms program as part of the Fall 2024 cohort, and I am excited to explore opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
